# TicTacToe
This application is a basic Tic Tac Toe game which you can play with a friend.

The application is setup to be only used in portrait. On the view you have the grid where you play and just above it 
you can see whose turn it is to play.
Once one of the player wins, or if it's a tie, a dialog pops out giving you the possibility to start a new game
